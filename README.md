# PowerBI_Report2
From Azure Cosmos db

I downloaded a data sample from Kaggle.com, converted the format from CSV to JSON, and uploaded the data file to Cosmos DB. 
I then connected Power BI to Cosmos DB to transform and clean the data.

Report has two sheets:

The first sheet presents the specifications of the individuals who were tested, while the second sheet provides more detailed data analysis.
